# Core Flight System : Framework : Tool : Ground System

This repository contains NASA's Lab Ground System (cFS-GroundSystem), which is a framework component of the Core Flight System.

This lab application is a non-flight utility ground system to interact with the cFS. It is intended to be located in the `tools/cFS-GroundSystem` subdirectory of a cFS Mission Tree. The Core Flight System is bundled at <https://github.com/nasa/cFS> (which includes cFS-GroundSystem as a submodule), which includes build and execution instructions.

See [Guide-GroundSystem.md](https://github.com/nasa/cFS-GroundSystem/blob/master/Guide-GroundSystem.md) for more information.

## Version History

### Development Build: 2.2.0-rc1+dev11

- Updated CHeaderParser.py to address specific issues.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/cFS-GroundSystem/pull/135>

### Development Build: 2.2.0-rc1+dev8

- Replaces old code that caused a cast-align warning when strict. Refactored and removed unnecessary code while also following recommended model for getaddrinfo. Removed old windows support/defines/etc (likely not tested for years, no longer supported).
- Reduce the size of the strncpy so that it ensures there's a null byte at the end of the string buffer.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/cFS-GroundSystem/pull/133>

### Development Build: 2.2.0+dev2

 - Fixes multiple typos
- See <https://github.com/nasa/cFS-GroundSystem/pull/127>

### Development Build: 2.1.0+dev85

- Remove unused code/packages to fix LGTM warnings
- See <https://github.com/nasa/cFS-GroundSystem/pull/120>

### Development Build: 2.1.0+dev76

- Fixes more lgtm warnings
- Allows users to change the byte offsets for sending commands and parsing telemetry, to support different header versions or other implementations of cFS

- See <https://github.com/nasa/cFS-GroundSystem/pull/109>

### Development Build: 2.1.12

- Change all individual UI elements to table widgets. Update backend code accordingly

### Development Build: 2.1.11

- Default behavior is the same except adds checksum and doesn't actually require fields. Adds all the packet fields, overrides, more supported data types, etc.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/cFS-GroundSystem/pull/101>

### Development Build: 2.1.10
