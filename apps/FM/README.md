Introduction
---------------

  The File Manager application (FM) is a core Flight System (cFS) application 
  that is a plug-in to the Core Flight Executive (cFE) component of the cFS.  
  
  The FM application provides onboard file system management services by 
  processing ground commands for copying, moving, and renaming files, 
  decompressing files, creating directories, deleting files and directories, 
  providing file and directory informational telemetry messages, and providing 
  open file and directory listings.

  The FM application is written in C and depends on the cFS Operating System 
  Abstraction Layer (OSAL) and cFE components. There is additional FM application 
  specific configuration information contained in the application user's guide
  available in https://github.com/nasa/FM/tree/master/docs/users_guide
