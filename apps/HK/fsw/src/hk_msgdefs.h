/** \hkcmd Housekeeping No-Op
**
**  \par Description
**       This command will increment the command execution counter and send an
**       event containing the version number of the application
**
**  \hkcmdmnemonic \HK_NOOP
**
**  \par Command Structure
**       #CFE_SB_CmdHdr_t
**
**  \par Command Verification
**       Successful execution of this command may be verified with the
**       following telemetry:
**       - \b \c \HK_CMDPC - command execution counter will
**         increment
**       - The #HK_NOOP_CMD_EID informational event message will
**         be generated
**
**  \par Error Conditions
**       There are no error conditions for this command. If the Housekeeping
**       app receives the command, the event is sent (although it
**       may be filtered by EVS) and the counter is incremented
**       unconditionally.
**
**  \par Criticality
**       None

/** \hkcmd Housekeeping Reset Counters
**
**  \par Description
**       This command resets the following counters within the HK
**        housekeeping telemetry:
**       - Command Execution Counter (\HK_CMDPC)
**       - Command Error Counter (\HK_CMDEC)
**       - Combined Packets Sent Counter (\HK_CMBPKTSSENT)
**       - Missing Data Counter (\HK_MISSDATACTR)
**
**  \hkcmdmnemonic \HK_RESETCTRS
**
**  \par Command Structure
**       #CFE_SB_CmdHdr_t
**
**  \par Command Verification
**       Successful execution of this command may be verified with the
**       following telemetry:
**       - \b \c \HK_CMDPC - command execution counter will be reset
**       - \b \c \HK_CMDEC - command error counter will be reset
**       - \b \c \HK_CMBPKTSSENT - combined packets sent counter will be reset
**       - \b \c \HK_MISSDATACTR - missing data counter will be reset
**       - The #HK_RESET_CNTRS_CMD_EID informational event message will
**         be generated
**
**  \par Error Conditions
**       There are no error conditions for this command. If the Housekeeping
**       App receives the command, the event is sent (although it
**       may be filtered by EVS) and the counter is incremented
**       unconditionally.
**
**  \par Criticality
**       This command is not inherently dangerous.  However, it is
**       possible for ground systems and on-board safing procedures
**       to be designed such that they react to changes in the counter
**       values that are reset by this command.
