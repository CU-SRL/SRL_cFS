core Flight System (cFS) Housekeeping Application (HK)
======================================================

Open Source Release Readme
==========================

HK Release 2.4.3

Date: 10/8/2020

Introduction
-------------
  The Housekeeping application (HK) is a core Flight System (cFS) application
  that is a plug in to the Core Flight Executive (cFE) component of the cFS.

  The HK application is used for building and sending combined telemetry messages
  (from individual system applications) to the software bus for routing. Combining
  messages is performed in order to minimize downlink telemetry bandwidth.
  Combining certain data from multiple messages into one message eliminates the
  message headers that would be required if each message was sent individually.
  Combined messages are also useful for organizing certain types of data. This
  application may be used for data types other than housekeeping telemetry. HK
  provides the capability to generate multiple combined packets (a.k.a. output
  packets) so that data can be sent at different rates (e.g. a fast, medium and
  slow packet).

  The HK application is written in C and depends on the cFS Operating System
  Abstraction Layer (OSAL) and cFE components.  There is additional HK application
  specific configuration information contained in the application user's guide
  available in https://github.com/nasa/HK/tree/master/docs/users_guide

About cFS
----------
  The cFS is a platform and project independent reusable software framework and
  set of reusable applications developed by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
  This framework is used as the basis for the flight software for satellite data
  systems and instruments, but can be used on other embedded systems.  More
  information on the cFS can be found at http://cfs.gsfc.nasa.gov
