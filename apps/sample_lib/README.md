# Core Flight System : Framework : App : Sample Lib

This repository contains a sample library (sample_lib), which is a framework component of the Core Flight System.

This sample library is a non-flight example library implementation for the cFS Bundle. It is intended to be located in the `apps/sample_lib` subdirectory of a cFS Mission Tree.  The Core Flight System is bundled at https://github.com/nasa/cFS (which includes sample_lib as a submodule), which includes build and execution instructions.

sample_lib implements SAMPLE_Function, as an example for how to build and link a library in cFS.
