# Core Flight System : Framework : App : MAX7502

This repository contains an i2c application (i2c) for the sensor MAX7502 temperature sensors found on our Adaptor Board v2 - Obsidian Flight System, which is a framework component of the Core Flight System.

## App Development Resources
Datasheet: [https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX7500-MAX7504.pdf](https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX7500-MAX7504.pdf)   
- Temperature Sensors largely operate similarly, so used our previous temperature sensor code and datasheet to code this app. There are not many resources available for this sensor, so in the future we may want to either order our older temperature sensors that have code or find a new one that is well-documented.

## Version Notes

- **0.1.0 BETA RELEASE**:
  - Initial release of the I2C App
  - Includes the driver for the MPL3115A2 for direct operation via the BeagleBone Black pins.
